<p>
Organizations are challenged to transform quickly and maximize ROI, while keeping traditional and modern
applications running together securely. Reclaiming productivity is key to giving teams back the time required to 
innovate and build resiliency.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, massive transformation programs are hard to greenlight and most fail to deliver immediate results. 
According to Gartner, AI augmentation will recover 6.2 billion hours of worker productivity in 2021 – time that 
can be invested in creating a solid and secure base for WebSphere transformation.
</p>
<p>
By leveraging AI and automation, organizations can achieve immediate savings and business benefits, while 
laying a solid and secure technology foundation for future growth.

With AI and automation, teams can modernize and secure their IT estate as well as adapt and respond to 
incidents efficiently. WebSphere system administrators can reduce the cost, effort, and risk of addressing vulnerabilities and anomalies, automate critical activities, preserve uptime and remediate capacity incidents.
</p>
<p>
IBM WebSphere Automation makes business efficiency and resiliency standard. It helps teams work less on 
maintenance tasks and gives time back to focus more on strategic activities, to extend the life, increase 
the ROI, and unlock new value from WebSphere investments.
